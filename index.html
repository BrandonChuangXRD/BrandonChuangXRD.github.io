        I am a software engineer, currently with a strong background in machine learning/AI.
        I am pursuing a Computer Science B.S. and expect to graduate in the winter of 2023. 
        During my last year, I plan to take as many upper division classes that
        heavily emphasize machine learning/AI so long as it does not interfere with a potential job offer.
